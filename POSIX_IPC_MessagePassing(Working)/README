File layout is as follows:

moderator user directory contains:
server.py
communication_server.py

player0 user directory contains:
client.py
communicationclient.py

player1 user directory contains:
client.py
communicationclient1.py

player2 user directory contains:
client.py
communicationclient2.py

player3 user directory contains:
client.py
communicationclient3.py



The communication script will be different across players and the moderator. No change has been made to the client.py and server.py. The communication between 
players and the moderator to do voting, chatting and connection are made through POSIC IPC Message Queues using Message Passing.




In order to setup posix_ipc we have to do the following setup:
Pip3 install posix_ipc
mkdir /dev/mqueue
mount -t mqueue none /dev/mqueue
ls /dev/mqueue
cd /dev/mqueue
chmod 777 message_queue_server
chmod 777 message_queue_player0
chmod 777 message_queue_player1
chmod 777 message_queue_player2
chmod 777 message_queue_player3
